# Exploratory_data_analysis
I use three forms of encoding, or categorical data transformations, to convert our categorical data into appropriate numbers for machine learning. One form is for converting labels, another is for nominal data, and the third is for ordinal data. Nominal data is categorical values that have no natural order.  Examples are colors, brands of products (unless we are ranking them by sales, quality, etc.!), and the like. Ordinal data is that which is naturally ranked, such as age, sizes, measurements, etc
